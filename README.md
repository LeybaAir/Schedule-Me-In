Work Day Scheduler

## Description

As an employee with a busy schedule I want to be able to add important events to a daily planner so I can manage my time effectively.
I will re-create from starter code (a simple calendar application) that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. 
This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Instructions
I am using a daily planner to create a scheduleand when I open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

When I scroll down I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

I view the timeblocks for that day and each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

When I click into a timeblock I can enter an event

When I click the save button for that timeblock the text for that event is saved in local storage

When I refresh the page the saved events persist

## Requirements
Satisfies all of the acceptance criteria plus the following:

Application deployed at live URL

Application loads with no errors

Application user experience is intuitive and easy to navigate

Application user interface style is clean and polished
